# general_assets
My asset repo for s&amp;box. Open source for anyone to use. This also has some ported assets from various games (primarily valve titles.) Those will be listed in their own seperate folder labeling what game they're from so there is no confusion.

Here is a quick rundown of how all of my folders are used.

Models - This includes every model in the repo and their required materials. 
I did this rather than putting them in materials so people could clone and use those seperate from my materials.

Materials - These are world textures. (Walls, Floors, Ceilings, ETC.)
